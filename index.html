        <p>I am currently studying a part-time <strong>BSc Computing and It(Software)</strong> started in october 2020.</p>
        <p>This course introduces its students to the whole computing landscape,
          laying out important foundations to understand how different technologies
          come together leveraging one another. It develops our understanding of what computers are,
          their respective architectures, and gives us hands-on introductions to Operating Systems with Linux,
          Networking with Cisco, Robotics with Python. We are taught to discuss and think about the future of computing
          with the advances in Cloud computing, IoT, Machine learning, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are being taught, by brilliant tutors with extensive experience in programming,
          Object Oriened Programming using Java, with all the terminology and constructs
          that are common to Object Oriented programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>As well as learning a language, we are taught data structures, algorithms and computability,
          equipping us to define and solve common problems, thinking about complexity and writing tests for our code</p>

      <div class="details">
        <p>I recently completed the Commerce project
           as a part of the Harvard CS50W 
           (Web Programming with Python and JavaScript) 
           course and it was an amazing experience. 
           The project required me to build an auction web application 
           that allows users to bid on items, manage their bids, comment
           on items and that displayed the winner of an auction.
        </p>
        <p>I built the application using Python and the Django web framework. 
          I learned how to use Django to handle user requests and render templates, 
          as well as how to connect to a database using the built-in ORM to store user 
          and bid information.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of the project was uploading and rendering model images, 
          as I had to make sure that the images were properly uploaded, resized and optimized for web use. 
          But it was also one of the most rewarding, as I felt confident that the application 
          was visually appealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project, I had to work independently,
           it was a bit challenging at the beginning but 
           I learned how to manage my time and prioritize tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the commerce project was an incredible learning 
          experience that allowed me to apply the concepts 
          I learned in the course to a real-world scenario. 
          I feel confident in my ability to continue to learn 
          and grow as a web developer, and I highly recommend 
          this project to anyone interested in web development and 
          specifically those who are keen to learn Django framework.
